## Resources

This site contains some reference information for Breath of the Wild. I
compiled this for myself because I'm bad at remembering large tables of
information, so, fair warning, that's all you'll find here: raw info. If
you want an explanation of mechanics, hints, walkthroughs, etc, there
are many sites out there. However, I wanted a clean design that I could
use on my phone while playing.

So far, the following pages are available:

  * [Armor Upgrades](/armor)
  * [Arrow Prices](/arrows)
  * [Lunar Cycle](/moon)
  * [Shrines](/shrines)
