# BoTW Reference pages

A microsite with some BoTW information I've compiled. For what/why, see
the live version: http://botw-reference.thingschange.tech

This repo uses `docs` in the `master` branch rather than `gh-pages`, to
make room for eventually adding tools to build the `_data` files from
real game data.

I'm a non-designer engineer but I tried to make a responsive layout as
all the other sources for this info on the web were too full of cruft to
comfortably check on my phone.
